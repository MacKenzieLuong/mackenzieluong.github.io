                            A chaotically fun rat-themed game created for Micro Jam 45's themes of "Miniature" and "Gambling Addiction". Players struggle 
                            (intentionally!) to control a cheese-obsessed rat to find any possible way to get more round. I designed over-the-top, 
                            cheesy UI elements and tried my hand at 3D texturing for the first time. As this game had to be completed in 48 hours, the designs were
                            mainly low fidelity sketches created in Procreate to quickly iterate and adapt to the fast-paced development cycle.

                            This was one of the largest learning curves I had, as I went in with little knowledge on medical software programs. 
                            Partnered up with a Nursing student, we were tasked to create a high fidelity Figma mock up of a health platform to help
                            clinicians use software to help patients in remote areas. Although I am unable to share our full designs due to confidentiality agreements, 
                            I will discuss more about the design process and my learning curve of working with a completely new field for software.

                            My first high fidelity mockup is for an Android app for event hosting and sign ins. Working collaboratively with other CS students, 
                            we developed a consistent design system inspired by popular social apps while ensuring intuitive navigation.
                             We also wanted to keep a cute blue theme as a reference to the pokemon Marill, who was also our team name!
                            This project was my first large step for my understanding of Figma's collaborative features and mobile design patterns.
