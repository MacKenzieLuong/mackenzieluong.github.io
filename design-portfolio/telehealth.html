                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>In partnership with a Nursing student, I designed UI improvements for <a href="https://www.telerehabilitationcollaboration.com/" target="_blank">Telerehabilitation Collaboration</a>, a platform connecting clinicians across healthcare organizations to share expertise and resources. This was my first experience working with real stakeholders through bi-weekly progress meetings.</p>
                <p><strong>My Role:</strong> UI/UX Designer, responsible for visual design, information architecture, and stakeholder communication</p>
                <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, stakeholder interviews, healthcare accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)</p>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> October 2024 - January 2025 with bi-weekly stakeholder check-ins</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot share full designs but can discuss process, methodology, and learnings.</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>The Telerehabilitation Collaboration platform needed UI improvements to better serve clinicians managing patient care across multiple healthcare organizations. The primary challenges were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legacy System Constraints:</strong> Healthcare applications typically run on older systems - the goal wasn't modernization, but clarity within existing technical limitations</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Organization Scaling:</strong> Design needed to accommodate future partner organizations without looking fragmented or disconnected</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency Requirements:</strong> Maintaining visual and interaction consistency so additional partner applications would feel cohesive, not like separate extensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical Workflow Integration:</strong> Interface had to fit into busy clinicians' existing workflows without adding cognitive load</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Learning Curve</h2>
                <p>This project was my first experience with real stakeholder collaboration. The biggest learning curve wasn't the design itself, but understanding how healthcare systems actually work.</p>

                        <h4>✓ What This Project Taught Me</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Domain expertise matters:</strong> I couldn't design effectively without understanding clinical workflows. Collaborating with my nursing partner was essential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility is not optional:</strong> Designing for my grandparents' generation made accessibility personal. I learned it's not just about compliance - it's about respect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Constraints drive better design:</strong> WCAG requirements and HIPAA limitations forced me to think creatively about solutions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Healthcare is high-stakes:</strong> Unlike my game design work, mistakes here could impact patient care. This raised my standards for clarity and error prevention.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>△ What I'd Do Differently</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Earlier stakeholder involvement:</strong> Would have sought clinician feedback sooner in wireframe stage</li>
                            <li><strong>Usability testing:</strong> Academic constraints limited real user testing - would prioritize this in future healthcare projects</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical feasibility check:</strong> Some designs may have been challenging to implement - would loop in developers earlier</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>💡 Key Takeaway</h3>
                    <p>This project transformed my approach to design. Seeing my grandparents struggle with interfaces isn't just motivation - it's a responsibility. Good design in healthcare can literally improve quality of life. I learned that empathy, combined with rigorous accessibility standards, creates interfaces that work for everyone, not just the tech-savvy.</p>
