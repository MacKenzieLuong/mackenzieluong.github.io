                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Marill is an Android application for event hosting, management, and attendee check-ins, built as a semester-long software engineering project. While this was primarily a development-focused project, I took on dual roles as <strong>software architect and UI designer</strong>, managing the technical architecture, coordinating development, and creating the visual design system.</p>
                <p><strong>My Primary Roles:</strong> Software Architect, Project Manager, UI/UX Designer</p>
                <p><strong>Team Context:</strong> Led a team of 4 CS students through full-stack Android development while simultaneously designing the interface</p>
                <p><strong>Design Note:</strong> This was my first UI design project. While the work shown here represents early-stage design skills, I'm proud of creating a functional, cohesive system that successfully guided development. The <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/IB1hJMCJ2e2CWzZvdNK1zb/Marill_manyEvents?m=auto&t=McnZ58YGnyIIazX1-1" target="_blank">complete Figma file</a> is available to view.</p>
                <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma (design and prototyping), collaborative design features</p>
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Named after the Pokémon Marill, inspiring our playful blue color theme!</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>University students and event organizers face challenges managing event attendance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organizers:</strong> Manual check-ins are slow and error-prone, especially for large events. No easy way to track attendance trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attendees:</strong> Paper sign-ups are tedious. Discovering campus events is difficult and scattered across platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Hosts:</strong> Limited tools to promote events and engage with potential attendees before events.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Technical Challenge:</strong> Design a scalable Android application architecture that supports real-time check-ins, QR code scanning, and role-based permissions (attendees vs. organizers).</p>
                <p><strong>Design Challenge:</strong> Create my first UI design system that could guide 4 developers through implementation while learning industry design tools and patterns.</p>

                        <h4>✓ What Went Well</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Design system approach:</strong> Investing time upfront in components paid off. Developers loved having a single source of truth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Playful branding:</strong> The Marill theme made the project memorable and gave us identity in a crowded event app space.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobile-first thinking:</strong> Designing for Android constraints taught me to embrace platform conventions, not fight them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Team collaboration:</strong> Regular check-ins with developers prevented late-stage surprises about feasibility.</li>

                            <li><strong>More user testing:</strong> Only tested with 8 users due to time constraints. Would do guerrilla testing on campus for faster feedback loops.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility earlier:</strong> Added contrast checks late in process. Should have been part of design system from day one.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developer education:</strong> Team wasn't familiar with design handoff best practices. Would create onboarding doc explaining Figma Inspect and component usage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dark mode:</strong> Didn't plan for it initially, causing rework. Should have designed both themes simultaneously.</li>

                    <h3>💡 Key Takeaway</h3>
                    <p>This project transformed me from a designer who makes pretty screens to one who thinks in systems. Working with developers taught me that design is a conversation, not a handoff. The Marill blue theme proved that even enterprise-like apps (event management) can have personality and playfulness. Most importantly, I learned that constraints - whether technical limitations or Android's design guidelines - aren't obstacles. They're creative fuel that push designs toward elegant simplicity.</p>
