                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Marill is an Android application for event hosting, management, and attendee check-ins, built as a semester-long software engineering project. While this was primarily a development-focused project, I took on technical and visual design and project management responsibilities, planning the technical architecture, coordinating development, and collaborating on the high fidelity mockups. Named after the Pokémon Marill (a water-type!), we integrated water-inspired elements throughout the mockups and embraced a sea blue theme.</p>

                    <p><strong>📝 Design Note:</strong> This was my first UI design project. While the work shown here represents early-stage design skills, I'm proud of creating a functional, cohesive system that successfully guided development.</p>

                <p><strong>Team Context:</strong> 6-person team - 3 members focused primarily on code, 3 of us (including myself) split time between UI design and programming</p>
                <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma (design and prototyping), Android Studio, Firebase</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>University students and event organizers face challenges managing event attendance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organizers:</strong> Manual check-ins are slow and error-prone, especially for large events. No easy way to track attendance trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attendees:</strong> Paper sign-ups are tedious. Discovering campus events is difficult and scattered across platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Hosts:</strong> Limited tools to promote events and engage with potential attendees before events.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Technical Challenge:</strong> Design a scalable Android application architecture that supports real-time check-ins, QR code scanning, and role-based permissions (attendees vs. organizers).</p>
                <p><strong>Design Challenge:</strong> Create my first UI design system that could guide 4 developers through implementation while learning industry design tools and patterns.</p>

                <h2>Figma Design System</h2>
                <p>As a developer designing for developers, I built a tech-forward design system that speaks their language. Rather than creating beautiful but confusing mockups, I focused on making the Figma file a functional tool for implementation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Labeled each screen and scenario with corresponding user stories directly on mockup frames. Each flow was clearly marked, ensuring all tasks were covered and accounted for in the UI - no separate documentation to hunt for.</p>
                            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Team could immediately see which user story each screen addressed, making it easy to verify completion and understand context. This labeling system ensured nothing was missed and kept everyone aligned on what was being built and why.</p>

                    <p><strong>💡 Bridging Tech & Design:</strong> My CS background shaped how I approached design. Instead of treating Figma as an art tool, I used it like a codebase - organized, documented, and built for collaboration. This "developer-first" design approach became my strength: I create designs that engineers love to implement.</p>

                <p><strong>Course Structure:</strong> The project had 2 major milestones requiring high-fidelity Figma mockups at each checkpoint. Since developers needed designs before they could start coding, I had to create complete mockups much earlier than typical design timelines. The team split work - half focused on mockups, half focused on technical architecture.</p>

                        <p>Reviewed project spec and design requirements. Defined user stories and split team responsibilities - design team would focus on mockups while technical team tackled architecture, diagrams, and backend planning.</p>

                        <p>Created first high-fidelity mockups based on prioritized user stories. Established core design system (colors, typography, basic components) while the other half of the team worked on technical specifications.</p>

                        <p>Completed at least half the project mockups for Milestone 1. Focused on customer-facing features (event feed, event details, check-in flow) and left admin UI for second half. This allowed us to shift focus to technical work - diagrams, architecture documentation, and code implementation.</p>

                        <p>Completed remaining user stories including organizer dashboard and admin interfaces. Delivered comprehensive mockup covering full application. With mockups finished, entire team could focus on code implementation and technical deliverables for final milestone.</p>

                        <h4>✓ What Went Well</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Design system approach:</strong> Investing time upfront in components paid off. Developers loved having a single source of truth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Playful branding:</strong> The Marill water-type theme made the project memorable and gave us identity in a crowded event app space.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobile-first thinking:</strong> Designing for Android constraints taught me to embrace platform conventions, not fight them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Milestone-driven design:</strong> Being forced to deliver complete mockups early taught me to make confident decisions quickly.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Limited user testing:</strong> Only tested with our 6 team members due to time constraints. Should have done guerrilla testing on campus for external feedback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Role clarity:</strong> Most team members wore multiple hats (design + code), which meant no one could focus deeply on one area. Would push for clearer role division.</li>
                            <li><strong>No dark mode:</strong> Didn't implement dark mode - would have required too much additional work given our split responsibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility earlier:</strong> Added contrast checks late in process. Should have been part of design system from day one, especially with our all-blue color scheme.</li>

                    <h3>💡 Key Takeaway</h3>
                    <p>This project transformed me from a student who can code and draw to someone who ensures that the feature requests are met, in both design and in implementation. Working with developers taught me that design is a conversation, not a handoff. The Marill water-type theme proved that even functional apps (event management) can have personality and also helped our team bond since we all loved that cute blue ball creature. Most importantly, I learned how important it is to balance the technical, design, and management aspects of a project. Everyone has a key role and contributes to the final product.</p>
