                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>ratund is a chaotically fun rat-themed game created for Micro Jam 45, a 48-hour game jam centered around the themes "Miniature" and "Gambling Addiction." As the sole designer, I was responsible for all visual elements, including UI design, 3D texturing, and character design.</p>
                <p><strong>My Role:</strong> UI/UX Designer, 3D Texture Artist, Visual Designer</p>
                <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Procreate (for UI sketches and 2D art), Blender/3D Software (for texturing)</p>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Game jams present a unique design challenge: create compelling, cohesive visuals in an extremely compressed timeline while supporting gameplay that's intentionally chaotic. The game needed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Miniature Theme:</strong> Visually communicate scale and perspective to make players feel tiny</li>
                    <li><strong>Intentional Chaos:</strong> Support difficult controls without frustrating players</li>
                    <li><strong>Personality:</strong> Convey humor through over-the-top cheese aesthetics</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Iteration:</strong> Allow for quick changes as gameplay mechanics evolved</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p><strong>Game Jam Players:</strong> Indie game enthusiasts who appreciate quirky, experimental games with unique mechanics and humor. They're forgiving of intentional jank when it serves the gameplay concept.</p>

                        <h3>⏰ Time Constraint</h3>
                        <p>48-hour deadline required rapid prototyping and low-fidelity approaches to allow for iteration.</p>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>Research & Inspiration</h2>
                <p> After discussing with the team with our themes, miniature and gambling addiction, we went through a heavy brainstorming session and all agreed that we just wanted to make something silly and fun. We took inspiration from indie games that used intentional difficulty as a mechanic (e.g., Goat Simulator, Getting Over It) to add to the sillyness and a tiny rat stuck in a casino, where the player is addicted to the silly game loop.</p>
                <div class="insight-box">
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Players embrace frustration when it's wrapped in humor and visual charm.</p>
                </div>
                <p>For the "miniature" theme, I researched exaggerated perspective and scale in games like Pikmin to understand how to make players feel small. We wanted to overexagerate the environment and ensure the player feels like the rat, small in an unknown casino, ready to mess around with whatever is interactable!</p>

                        <h3>Concept & Rapid Sketching (Hour 1-8)</h3>
                        <p>Analyzed "Miniature" + "Gambling Addiction" themes and brainstormed concepts. Created 20+ low-fidelity sketches in Procreate exploring UI layouts, rat designs, and cheese aesthetics. Prioritized speed over polish to support rapid iteration and shared designs with the team to align vision.</p>

                        <p>Designed over-the-top UI filled with rat and cheese motifs. Polished initial assets for clarity and playtested builds to ensure effectiveness. Created consistent visual language across all interface elements.</p>

                        <p>Learned 3D texturing basics while creating cheese textures for environment. Embraced imperfection - the slightly janky and painted textures actually enhanced the low poly, sketchy aesthetic we were going for.</p>

                        <p>Implemented and polished remaining UI elements. Consistent playtesting ensured proper rendering and visual quality. Made final adjustments to balance chaos with clarity across all game states.</p>

                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> UI elements remain completely unaffected and stagnant despite gameplay chaos. The game itself is intentionally not UI-heavy - chaos is expected and part of the enjoyment. Dialogue boxes and interactions stay clear, allowing players to focus on the mayhem without confusion.</p>

                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> When the rat gets drunk, the entire screen wobbles dramatically while the cheese meter (critical UI) stays stagnant. This optional gameplay element pokes fun at the chaos - "yes, it can get worse!" The rendering approach creates gameplay-affecting visual changes without compromising core UI readability.</p>

                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Color + shape redundancy for critical UI elements; the rat/player was always visible and at a consistent location.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rapid Iteration:</strong> Low-poly aesthetic wasn't compromise - it was strategic choice enabling fast iteration cycles under 48-hour deadline</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> Non-verbal state indicators (sound effects, moving objects/animations, line rendering shows what was being focused) reduce cognitive load during fast gameplay, even without clear visuals.</li>

                        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Embrace sketchy, low-poly look with silly theme and visuals.<br>
                        <strong>Rationale:</strong> Time constraints made polish impossible, so I leaned into a sketchy and silly style that fit the theme and chaotic nature of the game perfectly.</p>

                        <strong>Rationale:</strong> Reinforces "miniature" theme by making the rat feel tiny in comparison to the world. We want to make sure that the miniature theme was not an oversight, but a deliberate design choice.</p>

                    <p>Constraints breed creativity. By accepting imperfection and leaning into the chaos, I created a cohesive aesthetic that enhanced the player experience. This project taught me that "good enough" design that ships is better than perfect design that doesn't.</p>
